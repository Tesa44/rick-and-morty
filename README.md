# Rick & Morty Characters

**Rick and Morty Characters** is a responsive web application built with React that allows users
to search and browse characters from the  *Rick and Morty" uniwerse using the public [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)

and fast project showcasing API integration, dynamic filtering and modern frontend development practices.
